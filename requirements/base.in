# Work around setuptool issues!
#
# -> add some development-only libs or sub-dependency packages below.
# This is a dirty fix required since pip>=9.0.2/setuptools>39
#
# Those packages appear in constraints.txt, and were installed by mistake
# in the base image by the previous versions of pip, even though not used
# at all.
#
# The latest pip/setuptools fixed that (the constrained libs
# are not installed anymore if not present in the `base.in` file)...
#
# ... unfortunately, now eve complains that the libraries are missing
# upon boot! The truth is out there.
