Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
    Don't write directly to this file!
    Eve use towncrier to manage its release notes.
    You should instead add a file in eve/newsfragment directory named following
    this pattern: <JIRA-TICKET>-whatever-you-want.<type>
    The available types are:
      * feature
      * bugfix
      * doc
      * removal
      * misc
    At release time, the release notes are then generated using:
    tox -e relnotes <eve-version>

.. towncrier release notes start
