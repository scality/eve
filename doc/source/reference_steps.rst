Custom steps
============

A CI build running on Eve can use all the standard build steps provided by Buildbot, and also a list of additional steps that are provided by Eve itself. The standard steps are described in (`Buildbot's online documentation <http://docs.buildbot.net/current/manual/cfg-buildsteps.html>`_). The custom steps are described in this section.
